# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple Python implementation of the classic game for two players.

## Description

This program allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other on the command line. The game follows standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved a win, the game ends in a tie.
